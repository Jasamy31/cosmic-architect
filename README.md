Cosmic Architect

A Universe-Building Simulation Game

Cosmic Architect is an interactive simulation game where you take on the role of a celestial engineer, guiding the formation of galaxies by strategically placing and removing gravitational attractors. Observe the mezmerizing dance of particles and strive to create stable cosmic structures before time runs out!

How to Play

  Start the Game: Click the "Start Game" button on the initial message screen.
  
  Orbit the View: Use your mouse to click and drag to orbit around the simulation space and get a better view of the particles.
  
  Place Attractors:
  
  Click the "Place Attractor" button.
  
  The button will change to "Click to Place" and turn green.
  
  Click anywhere on the simulation canvas to place a new gravitational attractor. This will cost Cosmic Energy.
  
  Remove Attractors:
  
  Click the "Remove Attractor" button.
  
  The button will change to "Click to Remove" and turn red.
  
  Click near an existing attractor on the simulation canvas to remove it. This will refund Cosmic Energy.
  
  Observe and Adapt: Watch how particles react to your attractors. Form clusters and observe the "Galaxies Formed" counter.
  
  Manage Resources: Keep an eye on your "Cosmic Energy" (moves) and the "Time Left."


Game Elements

  Particles: The basic units of the universe, constantly moving and interacting with gravitational forces.
  
  Attractors (Proto-Galaxies): Gravitational centers that pull particles towards them. When enough particles gather around an attractor, it forms a "Galaxy." Formed galaxies turn green.
  
  Cosmic Energy (Moves): Your limited resource for placing attractors. Removing an attractor refunds energy.
  
  Galaxies Formed: The number of stable galaxy structures you have successfully created. Your objective is to reach the Target Galaxies Needed.
  
  Entropy: A measure of the disorder or spread of particles in the universe. Lower entropy generally indicates more structured formations.
  
  Cosmic Events: Random events that occur periodically, such as new attractors appearing, existing ones vanishing, or black holes forming.
  
  Black Holes: Temporary, powerful gravitational singularities that suck in nearby particles, obliterating them.
  
  Particles Obliterated: A count of particles consumed by black holes.


Winning and Losing

  Win Condition: Form targetGalaxiesNeeded (default: 10) galaxies before the time runs out.
  
  Lose Condition: Run out of time. This triggers a "Big Crunch" event where all remaining particles are pulled into the center, signifying the end of the universe.


Technologies Used

  HTML5: For the basic structure of the game.
  
  CSS3 (Tailwind CSS): For styling and responsive layout.
  
  JavaScript: For game logic and interactivity.
  
  Three.js: A powerful 3D JavaScript library used for rendering the particles and attractors in the simulation.
  
  OrbitControls.js: A Three.js example utility for easy camera navigation.


Future Improvements

  More Diverse Cosmic Events: Introduce new types of events, such as supernovas, nebula formation, or wormholes.
  
  Upgradable Attractors: Allow players to upgrade attractors to increase their mass or influence radius.
  
  Particle Customization: Options for different particle colors, sizes, or textures.
  
  Save/Load Game: Implement functionality to save and load game progress.
  
  Sound Effects and Music: Add ambient space music and sound effects for interactions.
  
  Score Tracking: Keep a high score based on galaxies formed, remaining energy, and time.
